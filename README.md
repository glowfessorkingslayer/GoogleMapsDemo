[Node.js installation](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
[Yarn installation (AFTER installing Node](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/#windows-stable)


1. Install the library from npm:

```sh
npm install react-native-maps --save-exact
```

or from yarn

```sh
yarn add react-native-maps -E
```

2. In order to autolink the react-native-maps module to your project & avoid editing build config files for ANDROID react-native apps, run the following command:
```sh
yarn add react-native-webview
```

3. Obtain an [API key for the Android Maps SDK](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android-sdk/signup).
